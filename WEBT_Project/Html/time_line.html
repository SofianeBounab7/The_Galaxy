            <h3>Big Bang</h3>
            <p>The Big Bang theory is a cosmological model for the observable universe[1][2][3] from the earliest known periods through its subsequent large-scale evolution.
              The model describes how the universe expanded from a very high-density and high-temperature state,[7][8] and offers a comprehensive explanation for a broad range of
              phenomena, including the abundance of light elements, the cosmic microwave background (CMB), large-scale structure and Hubble's law (the farther away galaxies are, the
              aster they are moving away from Earth). </p>

            <h3>Nebula</h3>
            <p>A nebula (Latin for 'cloud' or 'fog';[2] pl. nebulae, nebulæ or nebulas[3][4][5][6]) is an interstellar cloud of dust, hydrogen, helium and other ionized gases. Originally, the term was used to describe any diffuse astronomical object, including galaxies beyond the Milky Way. The Andromeda Galaxy, for instance, was once referred to as the Andromeda Nebula (and spiral galaxies in general as "spiral nebulae") before the true nature of galaxies was confirmed in the early 20th century by Vesto Slipher, Edwin Hubble and others. </p>

            <h3>Galaxy</h3>
            <p>A galaxy is a gravitationally bound system of stars, stellar remnants, interstellar gas, dust, and dark matter.
            The word galaxy is derived from the Greek galaxias (γαλαξίας), literally "milky", a reference to the Milky Way. Galaxies range in size from
            dwarfs with just a few hundred million (108) stars to giants with one hundred trillion (1014) stars,[3] each orbiting its galaxy's center of mass. </p>

            <h3>Gr. Singularity</h3>
            <p>A gravitational singularity, spacetime singularity or simply singularity is a location in spacetime where the gravitational field of a celestial body is
              predicted to become infinite by general relativity in a way that does not depend on the coordinate system. The quantities used to measure gravitational field
              strength are the scalar invariant curvatures of spacetime, which includes a measure of the density of matter. Since such quantities become infinite at the singularity,
              the laws of normal spacetime break down.</p>
