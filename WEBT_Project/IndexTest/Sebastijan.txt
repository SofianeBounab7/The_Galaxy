- Authors are the following: Sebastijan Bogdan, Sofiane Bounab and Dennis Zhao - 2AHIF 19/20.
<p># Short Description - Website</p>
<p>- This is a school project about Stars, Galaxies, Nebulae, how are the stars born, how will a star die and much more.</p>

<p> # Short Description - App</p>
<p>- The app will be a .json server which will have a search bar for the user to search for a certain star. </p>
<p>- The data that will show will be as detailed as possible about that certain star. E.g. name, size, elements, approx. age, is the size
  enough for a supernova, in which galaxy is the searched star.</p>
<p>- We will also try to work on finding a nice way to expand our data base as efficiently as possible.</p>
<p># Info</p>
<p>- We have 5 branches of pages. Every branch will have it's own unique topic to write about. </p>
<p>- These Branches will have their own personal design (design will not be very different from the main page) with a set wallpaper. </p>
<p>- In order to explain stuff more thoroughly we will also add some pictures/animation to get the general idea of how it looks like. </p>
